# git-github-playground

This repository is a **demo playground** for experimenting with Git and GitHub using the terminal.  
Here, I practice creating repositories, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, managing branches, and exploring various Git commands in a safe, hands-on environment.  

**⚠️ Note: This repo is for learning and experimentation only. It is not meant for production projects.**
